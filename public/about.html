<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Maryland but grew up for a bit in New York.  I've lived in many places all over the U.S. from little up.  I enjoy traveling and love meeting new people as well as seeing new places.</p>

<p>I've lived in Colorado for a number of years and saw many locations there.  Every weekend we would take road trips to visit so many National Parks and unusual locations throughout the state and other states right near Colorado.</p>

<p>I have recently purchased a home in West Virginia on a mountain.  My fiance' and I love to visit and see all the local wildlife in the area.  We will start fishing this summer there among many of the rivers that are close to our cabin...</p>
